This application uses a configuration file: doctorXDevConfig.txt
that is in JSON format.
The most important parts are:
servicesAPI - location of the services.cfc file to connect to the data layer.
dsn - the datasource name.

the file is only read on application start.
The application can be restarted with the url string appReInit=1
and then refresh the page again with appReInit=0.

A simple MYSQL database is required.
See the dbBackup folder for the restore data.
